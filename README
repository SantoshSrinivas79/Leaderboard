Leaderboard app base on Meteor.js Leaderboard using Ember.js.

Done this for practice purposes and designed based on the [Meteor Leaderboard](http://meteor.com/examples/leaderboard) example.

### TODO
Added option to select how many points to add.
Localstorage
Try to backed it with a DB (not sure the kind of DB suits it, maybe going with MongoDB)
